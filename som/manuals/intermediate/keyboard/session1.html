        <p>A musical <strong>keyboard</strong> is the set of adjacent depressible levers or keys on a musical
        instrument. They typically contain keys for playing the twelve notes of the Western
        musical scale, with a combination of larger, longer keys and smaller, shorter keys
        that repeats at the interval of an octave.</p>
        <p>Depressing a key on the keyboard makes the instrument produce sounds, either by
        the following actions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Making a hammer mechanically strike a string or tine (piano, electric
        piano, clavichord);</li>
          <li>Plucking a string (harpsichord);</li>
          <li>Opening a valve to let air flow through a pipe (pipe organ or accordion)</li>
          <li>Striking a bell (carillon in a church tower).</li>
          <li>Connecting to one or more circuits for electric and electronic keyboards
        (Hammond organ, digital piano, synthesizer, MIDI controller keyboard)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic29.png" /></div>
        <p>A <strong>pedal keyboard</strong> is a keyboard played with the feet, usually used with a pipe
        organ or theatre organ.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic30.png" style="width:400px" /></div>
        <p>The number of keys in a keyboard varies depending on the instrument. A pedal
        keyboard only has 12 keys. A small modern MIDI keyboard can have 25 or 49
        keys. Many home keyboards have standard 61 keys. And lastly, an acoustic piano
        has 88 keys.</p>

        <p>The first electric keyboard instrument was the Denis d'or, which was built by Vaclav
        Prokop Dovis in 1753. It was incorporated with 700 strings temporarily electrified to
        make it sound louder. It was 4.9 ft long, 3 ft wide and 3.9 high, and only has 14
        keys.</p>
        <p>Electronic keyboards nowadays are so portable you can carry it in one hand, and
        has lots of keys and different sounds, and lots of features.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic31.png" style="width:400px" /></div>
        <p><strong>All-in-one</strong>. These keyboards have a keyboard, sound or synthesizer
        module, an amplifier and a set of speakers. Their keys are either
        unweighted or not touch-sensitive at all. And they are inexpensive and
        considered as home keyboards.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic32.png" style="width:400px" /></div>
        <p><strong>Professional Keyboards</strong>. Unlike the all-in-one’s, these keyboards only
        have a keyboard and better sound module. They are intended to be
        plugged in to an external keyboard amplifier. But their advantage is having
        professionally weighted keys, meaning you can play with more dynamics,
        especially in stage pianos.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic33.png" style="width:400px" /></div>
        <p><strong>MIDI Controller Keyboards</strong>. These are just controllers; they do not have
        their own sound. They have to connect to an external sound module or a
        computer that has sound producing software, which then connects to an
        external keyboard amplifier to produce sound.</p>

        Common Keyboard Sounds for Worship

        <p>A modern electronic keyboard can generate different sounds. Below is a list of
        some of the most common sounds keyboardists use during worship session:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Piano</strong> sound. Piano has been a stable part of almost all genres of music
          – Pop, Classical, Rock, Ballad, Latin, etc. You can play piano as solo
          during worship or with the whole band. You can play it softly as
          background during altar calls, or you can play it hard during Rock praise
          songs.</li>
          <li><strong>Electric Piano</strong> sound. This is a softer version of the piano sound, usually
          used in Jazz and RnB styles of songs.</li>
          <li><strong>Pad</strong> sound. Unlike piano sound, this has long, smooth, ambient sound.
          Usually, you use this as a background for your main sound like piano or as
          a background for other band members like guitarists.</li>
          <li><strong>Strings</strong> sound. Strings are basically collection of violin (and alike)
          sounds, usually used to add volume to the music. You usually add strings
          sound to louder part of the songs like chorus and bridge.</li>
          <li><strong>Organ</strong> sound. Organ sound has been a huge part of early church music,
          and you can still use it today to add classic gospel effect on slow songs.
          You can play it smooth and silent like a pad sound or you can play it
          louder and crispier, with vibrato, during Rock songs.</li>
          <li><strong>Lead</strong> sound. Lead sound is used when you are doing solo with your
          keyboard while the rest of the band, including your pad and piano, is
          backing you up. Almost any sound can be lead sound – piano, strings,
          organ, synthesizer or traditional lead instruments like flute and saxophone.</li>
          <li><strong>Effects</strong> sound. Effects sound varies from sweeping bright pads to
          arpeggiated sequences, transforming shapes and phases. Just keep in
          mind that you are only adding right amount of flavors to the music, not
          destroying it and distracting the congregation.</li>

        <p>White keys produce <strong>neutral</strong> notes, which are neither sharp nor flat. Black keys
        produce <strong>sharp</strong> (or <strong>flat</strong>) notes depending on what neutral note is on its left or right.</p>
        We learned from music theory class that a sharp note has a corresponding flat
        counterpart and those two are located on one black key for each octave.</p>
        <p>For example, the first black key in the illustration is <code>C#</code> because it is at the right side
        of (or higher than) <code>C</code> white key. It is also <code>Db</code> because it is at the left side of (or lower
        than) <code>D</code> white key.</p>
        <p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Try to get another black key and tell what sharp and flat notes is it then
        explain why.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the popular <strong>Middle C</strong> is just the note <code>C</code> at the center of your keyboard.</p>

        staff to the left hand.</p>
