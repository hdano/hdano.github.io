        <h3>Electric Guitar</h3>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic55.png" /></div>
        <p><strong>Body</strong> - The main part of the guitar, where you'll find the bridge, and on electric guitars,
          the volume and tone controls.</p>
        <p><strong>Fingerboard</strong> - The part of the guitar where you place your fingers to play; the flatter
          side of the neck.</p>
        <p><strong>Neck</strong> - The bit that pokes out of the body, which the strings run along.
          Headstock - The bit at the end of the neck where the strings stop and we find the
          tuners.</p>
        <p><strong>Position Markers</strong> - The dots on the fretboard are a handy indicator of the 3rd, 5th, 7th
          and 9th frets. The 12th fret has two dots; then the pattern repeats.</p>
        <p><strong>Fretwires (or Strings)</strong> - The small strips of metal that go across the fingerboard.
        Frets - Actually means the spaces in between the fretwires.</p>
        <p><strong>Pick-ups</strong> - A pickup is found under the strings of an electric guitar, and ‘picks up' the
        sound. They contain magnets, and measure the changes of the magnetic field made by
        the moving strings.</p>
        <p><strong>Pick-up Selector</strong> - Most electric guitars have more than one pickup, and the selector
        will allow you to choose which is being used. You can often choose to use more than
        one at a time. Fender Stratocasters have three pickups, but have a five-way switch.
        Gibson Les Pauls have two pickups and a three-way switch.</p>
        <p><strong>Input Jack Socket</strong> - This is where you will plug your guitar in if you use an amplifier.
        Make sure the cable is pushed all the way in or it will make a lot of noise!</p>
        <p><strong>Strap Pin</strong> - This is thing that your guitar strap fits on.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic56.png" /></div>
        <p><strong>Bridge</strong> - The far end of the strings from the nut, on the body of the guitar, usually metal.
        This is where the ‘ball' will sit when you change your strings</p>
        <p><strong>Volume Knobs</strong> - These control the volume of the electric signal of your guitar. If
        you've got more than one pickup, you'll usually have more than one volume</p>
        <p><strong>Tone Knobs</strong> - Most guitars have one or two tone controls. These control the amount
        of bass (low) and treble (high) sounds that the guitar makes</p>
        <p><strong>Scratch Plate</strong> - Scratch plates have a couple of functions. On acoustics they are there
        to protect the body and on electrics they hold all the electronics in place and protect the
        wood.</p>
        <p><strong>Whammy Bar</strong> - This is a metal bar that comes out of the bridge in some instruments
        and by pushing it down will lower the pitch of the notes being played.</p>
        <p><strong>Tuners</strong> - The things that you turn to change the pitch of the strings. Usually found on
        the headstock.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic57.png" /></div>
        <p><strong>Nut</strong> - A bone or plastic
        (sometimes metal) piece at the
        end of the fingerboard near the
        headstock.</p>
        <p><strong>String Tree</strong> - Some guitars
        have a small 'tree' that the
        strings run under in between
        the nut and the tuning pegs, to
        keep the strings from jumping
        out of the nut. This isn't
        needed on most guitars.</p>
        <h3>Acoustic Guitar</h3>
        <p>Most of the terms on this page apply to both electric and acoustic guitars. Here are a
        few which are specific to acoustics:</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic58.png" /></div>
        <p><strong>Sound Hole</strong> - This is where the sound of the guitar will come out after it has bounced
        around inside!</p>
        <p><strong>String Peg</strong> - A string peg is a plastic (or sometimes metal) pin that holds the string in
        the bridge.</p>

        Notes in Guitar

        <p>Like what we learned on music theory, a
        musical note is literally a pitched sound. In
        guitar, you can play notes by plucking or
        strumming the guitar strings with your left (or
        sometimes right) hand while placing the
        fingers of your other hand on specific areas of
        the fretboard.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic59.png" /></div>
        <p>This is called a <strong>Note
        Circle</strong>. It shows all the 12 notes that exist in
        Western music.</p>
        <p>Notice that <code>A#</code> and <code>Bb</code> are the same note (called
        enharmonic if you want to be clever). They sound the
        same but have different names. Also notice that there is no
        note in between <code>E</code> and <code>F</code> or <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>. This is where the
        white notes are right next to each other on the piano
        keyboard.</p>
        <p>Moving clockwise around the circle makes the notes
        higher in pitch.</p>
        <p>The interval of a semitone (shown on the left) is the
        smallest step on the guitar, and is one fret. Two semitones
        make a tone (shown on the right), and these two intervals
        make up scales.</p>
        <p>The note circle can also be used to work out any note on
        the fingerboard by knowing only the note names of the
        open strings. Simply count clockwise around the circle,
        moving up one step for each fret, starting from the note of
        the open string.</p>
        <p>The drawing below shows where the neutral
        (neither sharp nor flat) notes are located in the fretboard of
        a guitar.</p>

        <p>We learned in music theory how to basically read and write music in general, but there
        is another easier way to write music specifically for guitars, called <strong>Guitar TAB</strong> (or guitar
        tablature).</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic61.png" /></div>
        <p>TAB has six horizontal lines that represent the six strings on the guitar. The top line is
        the thinnest string (first) and the lowest line represents the thickest (sixth) string. The
        numbers that are placed on the lines tell you what fret to play a note. You will only ever
        play the strings with numbers on; If a string has no number, don't play it. The <code>0</code> means
        that a string is played open, with no fingers pressing down the string on the frets.</p>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Hold the guitar properly. Keep the guitar balanced on your thigh, tight into your
          body. Keep the elbow of your strumming hand out of the way of the string, near the
          base of the guitar, so you can use your wrist to strum. Support the guitar neck with
          your fret hand (usually left).</li>
          <li>Hold the pick properly. Place the pick on the first knuckle of your pointer-finger,
          so it points straight toward your chest. Grasp it with your thumb securely.
          Alternatively, you can strum without a pick, using the thumb and pointer-finger of
          your non-fretting hand.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>First Chord</h3>
        <p>For the purpose of learning how to strum, position the fingers
        of your fretting hand (usually left) in the fretboard as described
        in the drawing at the right. This is called E major chord.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic62.png" /></div>
        <p>We will learn more about chords on next lessons. Press your
        fingers properly; otherwise, the guitar will not sound well.</p>
        <h3>Strumming Correctly</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Strum all strings downward (from low E to high E) between the sound hole
          and the bridge. Practice strumming the strings in different places to get a
          sense of the sound it creates.</li>
          <li>Strum all the strings equally and in rhythm. Play quarter notes, one strum
          each, trying your best to hit all the strings. Stay on tempo, counting your four
          strums per measure.</li>
          <li>Try upstrokes, strumming the guitar from the high E string to the low E. This
          is called an upstroke. Repeat step 2.</li>
          <li>Use your wrist. A good strum is all in the wrist, not from the elbow. Learn to
          keep your elbow tight into the instrument, using your wrist to strum.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>After a couple of uses, a guitar can be out-of-tune, meaning the notes it produces is no
        longer accurate. If that happens, you have to tune it.</p>
        <p>There are many ways to tune a guitar, the most common are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Electronic tuner</strong> – this is the easiest and the most accurate way. Normally, it can
          be either clipped on the headstock, built-in (acoustic guitar)
          or plugged as guitar pedal.<br />
          <img src="pics/pic66.png" /></li>
          <li><strong>Tuning to a Piano</strong> or Other
          Instruments – this means that you
          get another instrument that is
          already tuned, for example a piano,
          and match the tunes of your guitar
          with it. Usually, you will tune each
          note of open strings (E A D G B)
          with the same notes on piano.<br />
          <img src="pics/pic67.png" /></li>
          <li><strong>Relative Tuning</strong> – this is a common method of tuning but it requires at least one
          string (usually the lowest E) to be tuned accurately using a tuner or other
          instrument. Relative tuning involves comparing the tuning of adjacent string pairs.
          The higher pitched string in the pair is tuned in reference to the lower string.<br />
