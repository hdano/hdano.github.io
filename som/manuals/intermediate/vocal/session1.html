        <p>Your voice is part of your whole body and it's
        affected by the movement of surrounding
        muscles. You need to make sure your
        posture is correct, and that the supporting
        muscles, including shoulders and neck are
        relaxed and warm, otherwise you could strain
        your voice, and risk injury.</p>
        <p>How you stand is really important. We suggest:</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic92.png" /></div>
        <ul>
          <li>Stand up straight - imagine a string pulling you up from the top of your head.</li>
          <li>Place your feet shoulder-width apart, keep your knees unlocked.</li>
          <li>Your head should be upright, looking straight ahead.</li>
          <li>Keep your shoulders down and your abdomen relaxed.</li>
          <li>Try to relax - tension will prevent you from making a good sound.</li>
        </ul>

        Warming Up

        <p>Warm-up exercises will make sure your voice is ready to perform. Warm up your
        voice to avoid straining and damaging your vocal cords. Always take a deep breath
        before you start and try yawning - yawning opens up your throat and helps your
        voice resonate.</p>
        <h3>Exercise 1</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Breathe out through your mouth releasing all the air from your lungs.</li>
          <li>Once your lungs feel completely empty, relax your stomach muscles, open
        your mouth and let the air flood back in.</li>
          <li>Do this several times.</li>
          <li>Now breathe in again and when you release the air add an 'sss' sound. See
        how long you can hold it.</li>
          <li>Try this again using 'shh' and 'fff' sounds. This will help to build different vocal
        muscles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exercise 2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Close your eyes and spend a little time breathing in through your nose and out
          through your mouth. (When singing, you should breathe in through your nose
          and out through your nose and mouth.)</li>
          <li>When breathing in, imagine the breath going down into the lowest part of the
          lungs, keeping the shoulders down and relaxed.</li>
          <li>When breathing out, try to maintain your inflated shape, breathing out slowly
          until you feel as empty as possible.</li>

        Breathing While Singing

        <p>Breathing well will support your voice. Singing when there's no breath left is a
        common way of tiring your voice. Follow the steps below to help improve your
        breathing.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic93.png" width="400" /></div>
        <ul>
          <li>Breathe deeply from your lower lungs - imagine a rubber ring around your
        waist (your diaphragm)</li>
          <li>Breathe in and try to push the ring outwards.</li>
          <li>Breathe in through your nose and out through your nose and mouth.</li>
          <li>Avoid raising your shoulders as you breathe in - keep them relaxed and level.</li>
          <li>Relax! Tension will prevent you from making a good sound.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practice breathing regularly to improve your technique and build your capacity</p>
        <h3>Exercise 1 – Hissing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Breathe in to the count of 4, breathe out, hissing, to the count of 4</li>
          <li>Then, breathe in for 6, and hiss out for 10</li>
          <li>in for 6, out for 12</li>
          <li>in for 2, out for 12</li>
          <li>in for 4, out for 16</li>
          <li>in for 2, out for 16</li>
          <li>in for 4, out for 20</li>
          <li>in for 1, out for 20</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The idea is to monitor your breathing, and ensure that you can last through long
        phrases. Be economical with your breathing. Make sure the hiss is consistent; that
        it is not louder at the beginning than at the end. You are aiming for a smooth even
        sound.</p>
        <h3>Exercise 2 - Snatched Breaths</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Breathing in gradually, think of your lungs filling up in fractions, when you
          count. Focus on the diaphragm, being careful not to hold tension in the throat.</li>
          <li>On the count of '1' - breathe in (1⁄4 full)</li>
          <li>'2' - (1⁄2 full)</li>
          <li>'3' - (3⁄4 full)</li>
          <li>'4' - (full)</li>
          <li>5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 - breathe out, gradually.</li>
          <li>Repeat, on the count of '1' - breathe in (1⁄2 full) '2' - (full)</li>
          <li>3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 - breathe out gradually.</li>

        Vocal Range

        <p>Your range is the span between the highest and lowest notes you can sing. There
        are four main adult voice types - these are classified by their range:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Soprano</strong> – High female singing voice</li>
          <li><strong>Alto</strong> – Low female singing voice</li>
          <li><strong>Tenor</strong> – High male singing voice</li>
          <li><strong>Bass</strong> – Low make singing voice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To explore your range sing the note that comes most naturally to you. Gradually
        take the pitch up to the highest note you can sing without straining. Now take it all
        the way down to the very lowest note, again without straining. You can also try the
        above with a line from a song, raising or lowering the pitch each time you repeat it.</p>
        <p>Try some of the exercises below. Start in the middle of your range and make sure
        that you are not straining - if it hurts, or feels uncomfortable, stop. Drink room
        temperature water throughout. Give yourself a break in-between each exercise.</p>
        <h3>Exercise 1</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Starting within the most comfortable range for you, slowly go up and down
          throughout all your vocal range with an 'aah' sound.</li>
          <li>Breathe as slowly as possible, and snatch a breath when you run out, trying to
          ensure an almost perfect, continuous line.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exercise 2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Start in the middle of your range with the note that feels most comfortable for
          you.</li>
          <li>Hum 'mm' with mouth closed, gradually opening the mouth until you're singing
          'ah'.</li>
          <li>Do this over the count of 8. Try to feel the resonance on your lips and open up
          to a pure vowel sound.</li>
          <li>Move up to a note and hum - 'mm' turning into 'eh' (as in 'bed')</li>
          <li>Try a higher note with - 'mm' - 'ee'</li>
          <li>Then try a lower note - 'mm' - 'or' (as in 'door')</li>
          <li>And then lower again - 'mm' - 'ooh'</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exercise 3</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Start on a note that's comfortable for you, and slowly sing 'mee meh mah mor
          moo', all on the same note.</li>
          <li>Go up a note and sing it again. Repeat the phrase, going up a note each time.</li>
          <li>As you get higher, make sure the sound doesn't get lost in the back of your
          throat - remember to use your diaphragm, to avoid a weedy sound.</li>
          <li>When you reach your highest range, go down a note and sing it again.</li>
          <li>Go down as low as you can, but don't strain your voice.</li>
        </ul>
