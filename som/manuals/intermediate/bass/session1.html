        <p><strong>Snare Drum</strong> - provides the strongest regular accents, played with sticks and
        usually plays the upbeats of a song. It produces its distinctive sound due to
        the snare wires fitted to the underside of the drum which buzz and vibrate
        against the bottom drum skin</p>
        <p><strong>Tom-tom(s)</strong> - (or just <em>toms</em>) are drums without snares, played
        also with sticks. They provide the bulk of most drum fills and solos. Smaller
        toms produce higher sound than bigger ones.</p>
        <p><strong>Floor Tom</strong> - kind of tom that stands on the floor usually in three legs. It
        produces the lowest sound among the toms.</p>
        <p><strong>Bass drum</strong> - (also known as kick drum) gives a regular but often varied
        foundation to the rhythm and played by pedal. It is the lowest sounding drum
        in a drum set and usually gives the downbeats along with basic patterns</p>
        <p><strong>Hi-hat cymbal</strong> - (or simply hi-hat) keeps the fine rhythm much of the time,
        played by the right stick of a right-handed drummer. Changing between ride
        and hi-hat, or between either and a leaner sound with neither, is often used to
        mark a change from one passage to another, for example to distinguish verse
        and chorus.</p>
        <p><strong>Ride cymbal</strong> - usually a heavy, standard cymbal, about 20" in diameter. It
        most often used to keep a constant rhythm similar function of hi-hats.
        Drummers change between hi-hat and ride cymbal to mark change in
        sections of songs, such as chorus and bridges.</p>
        <p><strong>Crash cymbal</strong> - makes the strongest accents, marking crescendos and
        climaxes, vocal entries, and major changes of mood. It is often accompanied
        by a strong kick on the bass drum pedal, both for musical effect and to
        support the stroke. There are many sizes of crash cymbals and the smaller
        the size, the higher sound it will produce.</p>

        <p>A drumstick is what you use to play the drums, cymbals and other percussive accesories. Wooden sticks are usually made from trees like Hickory, Oak, Maple and Hornbeam. There are also plastic and metal drumsticks.</p>
        <p>Regardless of material, a drumstick has the following parts and elements:</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic75.png"></div>
        <p><strong>Tip</strong> -  key part of the drumstick as it touches your drums. It is usually made of wood or nylon and has different shapes like round, oval, tear drop, etc. The shape and material has a direct effect on your sound. </p>
        <p><strong>Shoulder</strong> - have a drastic impact on the feel of the stick. It greatly changes the weight distribution of the stick and the balance point of the stick.</p>
        <p><strong>Body / shaft</strong> - longest and biggest area of a drumstick. It is usually used to produce specialty strokes like the snare rim shots</p>
        <p><strong>Balance point / fulcrum</strong> - part of a drummer's grip that creates a stable point of contact with the stick and a pivot point such that the stick can rotate as a lever from that axis point</p>
        <p><strong>Grip area</strong> - thicker, counter balance end of a drumstick to hold it.</p>
        <p><strong>Butt</strong> - the other side of the tip. Drummers sometimes hold the stick in the shoulder and uses the butt-end for more powerful effect.</p>
        <p><strong>Diameter</strong> - How thick? The majority of sticks have a diameter of around 0.57" (1.45cm) but feel free to try thicker or thiner sticks that may match your feel. This also affects the overall weight of the stick.</p>
        <p><strong>Length</strong> - How long? The majority of sticks are around 16" (40.6cm) long. A longer drumstick will give you more reach but it will increase the overall weight of the stick.</p>

        <p>One of the most important techniques a drummer must know is how to hold the
        drumsticks properly. When you play the drums with the correct stick grip, you will get
        the maximum bounce and control out of your drumsticks. You will be able to play the
        drums with much more efficiency and power with the proper grips.</p>
        <p>There are different kinds of stick grips, but for today we will learn about the basics,
        which is the Matched Grip. To hold the stick with matched grip, follow the following
        steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Grasp the stick between the fleshy part of the thumb and the first joint of the
          index finger about 5 inches from the butt end of the stick. This point of contact
          is called the <strong>fulcrum</strong>.</li>
          <li>Curve the tip of the index finger gently around the stick and wrap the
          remaining three fingers lightly around the stick</li>
          <li>Lift your forearm until it is parallel to the inclination of the drum part you want
          to hit and with the tip of the stick about few inches near the center. This is
          also applicable for hi-hat and ride cymbals. For crash cymbals, position your
          forearm slightly lower so that the neck will touch the edge of the cymbal.</li>
          <li>Make a 90 degree angle with your forearm by slightly moving your elbow
          away from your body. This is called the Geman Grip.</li>
          <li>With your wrist, lift up the drum stick about 45 degrees.</li>
          <li>Finally, hit the drum part by quickly turning your wrist down allowing the stick
          to fall freely.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The bass drum has got to be one of the most important drums to develop on the drum
        set. This is because when the bass drum is played on time, correctly, and in its right
        place, the whole band sounds better.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Heel Up method</strong> is probably the common and easiest method of playing the kick
        drum. This will let you use your whole right leg to power the bass pedal. To do a heel
        up method, follow the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Place and relax your right foot at the pedal where the tip of your foot is 1‚ÅÑ4
          away from the higher portion of the pedal.</li>
          <li>Lift your heel using your leg where the tip of your foot still touching the pedal.
          The pedal beater should be 45 degrees away from the kick drum head.</li>
          <li>Finally, push down the weight of your leg where your heel will be at the same
          position as in step 1.</li>
