        <p>The <strong>bass guitar</strong>, <em>electric bass</em> or simply <em>bass</em> is the lowest-pitched member of the guitar family. Commonly, it has four strings, though there are popular models that have more or less strings.</p>
      
        <p>The bass guitar consists of three sections: The neck, the body, and the innards. The different parts of the neck and body are easy to see, but the innards aren't so obvious that you need to remove the cover to see them.</p>

        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic78.png" /></div>
        
        <h3>The Neck</h3>

        <p>The neck of the bass guitar falls under the dominion of the fretting hand (usually the left hand) and has the following parts:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Headstock</strong> - holds the tuning machines for the strings.</li>
          <li><strong>Tuning machines</strong> (also called <em>tuners</em> or <em>tuning heads</em>) - hold the ends of the strings and by turning the individual tuning heads, you can raises or lowers the pitch (sound) of that string.</li>
          <li><strong>Nut</strong> - small piece of wood, plastic, graphite, or brass that provides a small indentation to hold each string.</li>
          <li><strong>Fingerboard</strong> - flat side of the neck beneath the strings where frets are embedded.</li>
          <li><strong>Frets</strong> - thin metal strips perpendicular to the strings that determine the pitch of the note that's played.</li>
          <li><strong>Strings</strong> - connected to the tuning machines at one end and to the bridge at the other. The vibration of the strings produces the sound.</li>
          <li><strong>Back</strong> - where the thumb of your fretting hand rests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Body</h3>

        <p>The body of the bass guitar falls under the dominion of the striking hand (usually the right hand) and has the following parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pickups</strong> - magnets embedded in a plastic bar that lies underneath and perpendicular to the strings. They form a magnetic field, and the vibration of the string disturbs (or modulates) that field, which translates into electrical signal and turns into sound.</li>

            <li><strong>Controls</strong> -  knobs used for adjusting the volume and tone (bass and treble) of the pickups.</li>

            <li><strong>Bridge</strong> - attaches the strings to the end of the body.</li>

            <li><strong>Strap Pin</strong> and <strong>End Pin</strong> - metal knobs where you attach each end of your shoulder strap.</li>

            <li><strong>Jack</strong> or <strong>Input Jack</strong> - socket used for connecting the cord from your bass to the amplifier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The innards</h3>

        <p>The innards, sometimes referred to as the guts, aren't visible to the eye (they're hidden in the cavity of the instrument and covered with plates), but they're essential to the sound and feel of the bass guitar. The following list describes the innards of the bass guitar:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Truss Rod</strong> is an adjustable metal rod that runs the length of your bass guitar's neck. The truss rod controls the curvature of the neck and fingerboard and keeps them stable. If you need to make adjustments to it, you can reach it through the top or bottom of the neck.
            <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic79.png" /></div></li>

            <li>The <strong>electronics</strong> of a bass guitar are a collection of wires, potentiometers (for volume knobs) and other important-looking electronic items that help convert the vibration of the string into sound.
            <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic80.png" /></div></li>

            <li>The <strong>batteries</strong> are an option. If your bass has active electronics (electronics with their own power source), you have 9-volt batteries attached to the electronics.

        Notes in Bass Guitar

        <p>Like what we learned on music theory, a
        musical note is literally a pitched sound. In
        bass guitar, you can play notes using fingers or picks with your left (or
        sometimes right) hand while placing the
        fingers of your other hand on specific areas of
        the fretboard.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic59.png" /></div>
        <p>This is called a <strong>Note
        Circle</strong>. It shows all the 12 notes that exist in
        Western music.</p>
        <p>Notice that <code>A#</code> and <code>Bb</code> are the same note (called
        enharmonic if you want to be clever). They sound the
        same but have different names. Also notice that there is no
        note in between <code>E</code> and <code>F</code> or <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>. This is where the
        white notes are right next to each other on the piano
        keyboard.</p>
        <p>Moving clockwise around the circle makes the notes
        higher in pitch.</p>
        <p>The interval of a semitone (shown on the left) is the
        smallest step on the guitar, and is one fret. Two semitones
        make a tone (shown on the right), and these two intervals
        make up scales.</p>
        <p>The note circle can also be used to work out any note on
        the fingerboard by knowing only the note names of the
        open strings. Simply count clockwise around the circle,
        moving up one step for each fret, starting from the note of
        the open string.</p>
        <p>The drawing below shows where the neutral
        (neither sharp nor flat) notes are located in the fretboard of
        a bass sguitar.</p>

        <p><strong>Bass Tab</strong>, short for <em>bass tablature</em>, is a pretty simple system of music notation for bass. You will find it in music books, bass magazines, and all over the internet.</p>
        <p>It shows the strings of the bass guitar drawn horizontally, with the lowest-pitched string (the fattest one) at the bottom which has a tuning of <code>E</code>, then the upper strings are <code>A</code>, <code>D</code> and <code>G</code> respectively.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic83.png" width="400" /></div>
        <p>In bass tab, notes are indicated by fret number which are written on specific string where you should play them. Fret number <code>0</code> means open string.</p>
        <p>In this example you are to play the 3rd fret on the E-string followed by the 2nd fret on the A-string, then the 5th fret on the A-string, and finally the 5th fret on the D-string, then back down the same notes.</p>

        <h3>Left Hand</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Hold your left hand up open with the palm facing upward.</li>
          <li>Position your hand at the bottom of the bass neck, centered in the palm.</li>
          <li>Place the tip of your thumb on the middle of the back of the bass neck. Make sure that your fingertips are pointing upward.
          <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic88.png" /></div></li>
          <li>Gently spread your fingers onto the strings, with each finger close to an adjacent fret.</li>
          <li>Curl your fingers until your fingertips are touching one of the strings.
          <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic89.png" /></div></li>
          <li>Press each finger hard to the string one at a time. Change the pitch of the note and will produce sound using the right hand.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Right Hand: Finger-Style Technique</h3>
        <p>The name <strong>finger-style</strong> refers to the use of the index and middle fingers. It is widely used in various music styles such as country, rock and jazz, and used by famous bass guitarists such as Jaco Pastorius.</p>
        <p>Below are the basic steps to play bass guitar in finger-style:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Bring your right arm up while keeping your wrist, hand, and fingers relaxed. Keep your wrist at a 45-degree angle (approximately), keep your thumb facing your index finger, and keep your fingers gently curved, with your fingertips pointing to the floor. Bend your elbow and keep it slighty away from your rib cage.</li>
          <li>Rest your thumb onto the thumb rest or the pickup. Settle the weight of your arm onto your thumb, keeping your hand and shoulder in their most relaxed state.
          <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic85.png" width="300" /></div></li>
          <li>Reach for your high string with your index or middle finger. You have to stretch the thumb wider, move the hand lower and gently curve the other fingers for them not to be in the way.
          <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic86.png" width="300" /></div></li>
          <li>Reach for your lowest string. Move the hand higher making the thumb and index finger close enough.
          <div class="text-center"><img src="pics/pic87.png" width="300" /></div></li>
        </ol>

        <p>After a couple of uses, a bass guitar can be out-of-tune, meaning the notes it produces is no
        longer accurate. If that happens, you have to tune it.</p>
        <p>There are many ways to tune a bass guitar, the most common are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Electronic tuner</strong> – this is the easiest and the most accurate way. Normally, it can
          be either clipped on the headstock, built-in
          or plugged as bass guitar pedal.<br />
          <img src="pics/pic66.png" /></li>
          <li><strong>Tuning to a Piano</strong> or Other
          Instruments – this means that you
          get another instrument that is
          already tuned, for example a piano,
          and match the tunes of your bass guitar
          with it. Usually, you will tune each
          note of open strings (E A D G)
          with the same notes on piano.<br />
          <img src="pics/pic90.png" width="300" /></li>
          <li><strong>Relative Tuning</strong> – this is a common method of tuning but it requires at least one
          string (usually the lowest E) to be tuned accurately using a tuner or other
          instrument. Relative tuning involves comparing the tuning of adjacent string pairs.
          The higher pitched string in the pair is tuned in reference to the lower string.<br />
