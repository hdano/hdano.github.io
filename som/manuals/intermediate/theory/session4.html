        <p>A <strong>music genre</strong> is a conventional category that identifies pieces of music as
        belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It may be defined by the
        musical techniques, the styles, the context and content and spirit of the
        themes.</p>
        <p>The common basis for categorizing music are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Geographical origin – “Pinoy Rock” vs “Chicago Blues”</li>
          <li>Popular and traditional –“Pop” vs “Country”</li>
          <li>Time period – “New Age” vs “Classical”</li>
          <li>Techniques used – “Funk” vs “Jazz”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Music genres can also have <strong>sub-genres</strong> which arise by the development of
        new forms and styles of music and also simply by creating a new
        categorization.</p>

        <p><strong>Rock music</strong> is a genre of popular music that originated as <em>rock and roll</em> in
        the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in
        the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States.
        It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by
        <em>rhythm and blues</em> and <em>country music</em>.</p>
        <p>Typically, rock is <strong>song-based</strong> music usually with a <code>4/4</code> time signature using a
        verse-chorus form.</p>
        <p>The sound of rock is traditionally centered on the <strong>electric guitar</strong>, supported by
        an <strong>electric bass guitar</strong> and percussion produced from a <strong>drum kit</strong> that combines
        drums and cymbals. This trio of instruments has often been complemented by
        the inclusion of others, particularly keyboards such as the piano, Hammond
        organ and synthesizers.</p>
        <p>Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on <strong>musicianship</strong>, <strong>live performance</strong>,
        and an ideology of <strong>authenticity</strong> than pop music.</p>
        <p>Rock music produced other sub-genres such as Pop Rock, Heavy Metal,
        Progressive Rock, Punk Rock, etc. Among the popular artists under the rock genre are Elvis Presley, Beatles,
        Metalica, Dreamtheater and Rivermaya.</p>

        <p><strong>Pop music</strong> (a term that originally derives from an abbreviation of <em>popular</em>) is a
        genre of popular music, which originated in its modern form in the 1950s,
        deriving from rock and roll.</p>
        <p>Unlike rock, pop music focuses on <strong>vocals</strong>, <strong>melodies</strong> and <strong>lyrics</strong>. It emphasizes
        how a song was <strong>composed</strong> rather than how the musicians played it.</p>
        <p>Pop music also appeals to the <strong>general audience</strong>, rather than a particular
        culture. Pop songs tend to reflect existing trends to <strong>relate</strong> to people. Pop
        music encourages dancing with its <strong>dance-oriented</strong> rhythms.</p>
        <p>Pop music evolved into sub-genres including K-pop, Electropop, Latin Ballad, etc. Some of the popular artists under pop genre are Britney Spears, Michael
        Jackson, Katy Perry, Justin Beiber, etc.</p>
