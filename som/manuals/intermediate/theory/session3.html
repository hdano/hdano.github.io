        <strong>Rhythm</strong> refers to the element of time in music.<br />
        This includes everything from beats, measures, the groupings of notes into
        beats, to counting, to tempo, and the movement from one note to the next.</p>
        <p>Some important larger ideas connected to rhythm are time
        signatures, tempo, and note values.</p>
        <p>In musical terminology, <strong>Tempo</strong> (<em>Italian for time, plural: tempi</em>) is
        the speed or pace of a given piece. It is a crucial element
        of any musical composition, as it can affect the mood and difficulty of a piece.</p>
        <p><img src="pics/pic21.png" style="float:left">The tempo of a piece will typically be written at the start of a piece of music
        usually indicated in <strong>Beats Per Minute</strong> (BPM). This means that a particular note
        value (for example, a quarter note) is specified as the beat, and the
        marking indicates that a certain number of these beats must be played per
        minute.</p>
        <p>Tempo can be named as the following depending on the ranges of its BPM.<br />
        Below are some of familiar names:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Larghissimo</em> – very, very slow (20 BPM and below)</li>
          <li><em>Adagio</em> – slow and stately (literally, "at ease") (51–60 BPM)</li>
          <li><em>Moderato</em> – moderately (81–90 BPM)</li>
          <li><em>Allegro</em> – fast, quickly and bright (105–132 BPM)</li>
          <li><em>Presto</em> – very fast (168–177 BPM)</li>
          <li><em>Prestissimo</em> – extremely fast (178–208 BPM)</li>

        <p>In music notation, a <strong>note value</strong>, or <em>note
        duration</em>, indicates the relative duration of a
        note, using the color or shape of the note
        head, the presence or absence of a stem, and
        the presence or absence of
        flags, beams, hooks or tails.</p>
        A <strong>Rest</strong> in music indicates a silence of an equivalent duration.</p>
        <p>Here is a list of common note
        values in descending order:</p>
        <div class="text-center mb-1"><img src="pics/pic22.png" /></div>
        <p>The whole note/rest, for example, has twice value
        than the half note/rest, and so on. <br />
        <p><strong>Tie</strong> is a curved line that links two notes of the same pitch to show that their
        durations are to be added together. Do not be confused
        Tie with Slur, which is another curved line used to indicate
        that notes should be played smoothly and in one breath.</p>
        <p>A note value may be augmented by adding a dot after it.
        This dot adds the next lower note value, making it one
        and a half times its original duration.</p>

        Time Signature

        <p>The <strong>Time Signature</strong> (also known as <em>meter signature</em>) is a notational convention
        used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats are in each
        measure/bar and which note value constitutes one beat.</p>
        <p>In a musical score, the time signature appears at the beginning of the piece, as
        a time symbol or stacked numerals (such as <code>3/4</code>) immediately following the
        key signature (or immediately following the clef if the key signature is empty). A
        mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a <em>barline</em>, indicates a
        change of meter.</p>
        <p>Simple time signatures consist of two numerals, one stacked above the other:</p>
        <div class="text-center mb-1"><img src="pics/pic24.png" /></div>
        <p>The lower numeral indicates the
        note value which represents one
        <strong>beat</strong> (the beat unit).
        The upper numeral indicates how
        many such beats there are in a
        bar.</p>
        <p>For instance, <code>2/4</code> means two quarter-note (<em>crotchet</em>) beats per bar; <code>3/8</code> means three eighth-note (<em>quaver</em>) beats per bar.</p>
        <p>Here are few more examples with notations:</p>
        <div class="text-center mb-1"><img src="pics/pic25.png" /></div>
        <p>The most common simple time signatures are <code>2/4</code>, <code>3/4</code>, and <code>4/4</code>.</p>
        <p>A <strong>Semicircle</strong>, or <code>C</code> symbol, is sometimes used for <code>4/4</code> time, also called
        common time or imperfect time.</p>
        <div class="text-center mb-1"><img src="pics/pic26.png" /></div>
        <p>The symbol is derived from a broken circle
        used in music notation from the 14th
        through 16th centuries, where a full
        circle represented what today would be
        written in 3/2 or 3/4 time, and was called
        perfect time.</p>
