        <p>A note is literally a <strong>pitched sound</strong>. It also refers to a sign or symbol used in musical notation to represent the relative duration and pitch of a sound.</p>
        <p>We use letters <code>A</code> to <code>G</code> recursively to define the pitch of a note. A has lower pitch then <code>B</code>, <code>G</code> has higher pitch that <code>F</code>, and so on.</p>
        <p>When a note is higher that <code>G</code>, we use letter <code>A</code> again and when a note is lower than <code>A</code>, we use letter <code>G</code> again.</p>
        <p>This is an example of how notes are lined up:<br /><code>A B C D E F G A B C D E F G A B C D E F G A B C D E F G</code></p>

        Sharps, Flats and Neutrals

        <p>In between each note, there are also pitches that are either higher or lower – these are the sharps and flats.</p>
        <p><img src="pics/pic3.png" style="float:left" />
        A <strong>Sharp</strong> note, symbolized by <code>#</code>, has a pitch higher than the attached note but lower than the next note.<br />
        For example, <code>A#</code> (A Sharp) is higher than <code>A</code> but lower than <code>B</code></p>
        <div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-light mt-2">
          <strong>Caution:</strong> There are two notes that does not have sharp counterparts - these
          are <code>B</code> and <code>E</code>. If in case you encountered a <code>B#</code> in a musical piece, it actually
          means <code>C</code> and <code>E#</code> actually means <code>F</code>.
        </div>
        <p>This is an example of how sharp notes are lined up:<br />
        <code>A - A# - B - C - C# - D - D# - E - F - F# - G - G# - A - A# - B - C - C# -</code></p>
        <p><img src="pics/pic4.png" style="float:left" />
        A <strong>Flat</strong> note, symbolized by <code>b</code>, has a pitch lower than the attached note but
        higher than the previous note.<br />
        For example, <code>Bb</code> (B Flat) is lower than <code>B</code> but higher than <code>A</code></p>
        <div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-light mt-2">
          <strong>Caution</strong>: There are two notes that does not have flat counterparts – these
          are <code>C</code> and <code>F</code>. If in case you encountered a <code>Cb</code> in a musical piece, it actually
          means <code>B</code>. <code>Fb</code> actually means <code>E</code>.
        </div>
        <p>This is an example of how flat notes are lined up:<br />
        <code>Ab - A - Bb - B - C - Db - D - Eb - E - F - Gb - G - Ab - A - Bb - B - C - Db - D</code></p>
        <p>In case you noticed, sharps and flats are related to each other. If fact, A
        sharp note is equivalent to a specific flat note.<br />
        For example, if <code>A#</code> > <code>A</code> and < <code>B</code>, and <code>Bb</code> < <code>B</code> and > <code>A</code>, then <code>A#</code> = <code>Bb</code><br />
        Below is a list of sharps with their equivalent flats:<br />

        <p><img src="pics/pic5.png" style="float:left" />
        Lastly, when a note is neither sharp nor flat, it is called a <strong>Neutral</strong> note.<br />
        <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are neutral notes.</p>

        Staffs, Clefs and Ledger Lines

        <p>A <strong>Staff</strong>, or stave, is the foundation upon which notes are drawn.
        The modern staff comprises five lines and four spaces.<br />
        Every line and space on the staff represents a note.</p>
        <p>A <strong>Clef</strong> assigns individual notes to lines and spaces.<br />
        The two most common clefs are Treble and Bass clefs.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Treble clef</strong>, or G-Clef, is drawn on a staff where the center curve is at the
        second line.<br />
        It is also called G-clef because any note symble placed at the second line is
        assigned as <code>G</code>. Other note above the second line, including spaces, are higher
        than <code>G</code>, those placed below the second line are lower than <code>G</code>.</p>
        <p>This is an example of a treble clef on a staff with notes:</p>
        <div class="text-center mb-1"><img src="pics/pic7.png" /></div>
        <p>The <strong>Bass clef</strong>, or F-Clef, is drawn on a staff where the center curve is at the
        fourth line.<br />
        It is also called F-clef because any note symbol placed at the fourth line is
        assigned as <code>F</code>. Other note above the fourth line, including spaces, are higher
        than <code>F</code>, those placed below the fourth line are lower than <code>F</code>.</p>
        <p>This is an example of a bass clef on a staff with notes:</p>
        <div class="text-center mb-1"><img src="pics/pic8.png" /></div>
        <p>When you combine two staffs with treble and bass clefs,
        you will form a <strong>Grand staff</strong>.</p>
        <div class="text-center mb-1"><img src="pics/pic9.png" /></div>
        <p>Now, what happens if we ran out of lines and spaces above
        or below the staff? How can we write the <code>A</code> higher than the
        space above a Treble-clef staff, or the <code>C</code> lower than the
        space below the same staff?<br />
        The solution to this is by using a ledger line.</p>
        <p>A <strong>Ledger line</strong> is a small line that extends the lines in a staff<br />
        Below is an example of a ledger line in a staff with treble clef:</p>
